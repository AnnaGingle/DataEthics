                    <p class="blog-summary2">
                        To move from an “average, frustrated chump” to a pick-up artist (PUA), men must
                        learn a series of skills that break down the rules of courtship and romance. the Seduction
                        subreddit has more than 200,000
                        subscribers. On such boards, men swap tips on how to be more “alpha” and attract
                        women through a variety of tactics, including “negging”—subtle put-downs that
                        make women eager for approval—kino, or touching, and ways to get past “token
                        resistance,” or women’s refusal to have sex.
                        <img id="yelling" src="images/hands.png" <br>
                        While the gender politics of the seduction community were always problematic,
                        in the last few years, a subset of pick-up artistry has incorporated the ideology of
                        Men’s Rights Activism. In online forums like theredpill subreddit or the blog Return
                        of Kings, posters blame feminism for creating an unbalanced “sexual marketplace”
                        in which rich, good-looking, and confident men get their pick of women, while
                        most men are either left “involuntarily celibate,” or resigned to sleeping with old
                        or overweight women. These posts characterize this state of affairs as not simply
                        against their wishes, but as detrimental to society.
                        A blog post on <i>Return of Kings</i>, for instance, reads:
                        <br>
                        <i>"There’s no denying that long term relationships are on the decline. Social conservatives are
                            often described as hateful and misogynist for railing against promiscuity, but the
                            statistics don’t lie. Marriages in which the wife was a virgin
                            have an 80% chance of succeeding, while the figure for brides who have had 15
                            or more premarital partners is just 20%. Basically, there’s an ever-increasing
                            number of washed-up old hags out there who are coming to regret their earlier
                            promiscuity, and are now facing the realization that they will probably die
                            alone and childless"</i>

                    <p class="blog-summary2">
                        Andrew Anglin is best known as the founder and editor of The Daily Stormer, an
                        openly Neo-Nazi news outlet that claims to be “The World’s Most Visited Alt-Right
                        Web Site.” Modeled after 4chan and 8chan, the site heavily utilizes racist memes
                        and imagery and encourages active comment threads below each piece. 4chan
                        greatly influenced Anglin’s own fascist beliefs, and he claims that he is “at heart a
                        troll.""
                        <br>
                        Anglin is acutely aware of the influence he wields among his site’s readers, known
                        as the “Stormer Troll Army” or just the “Stormers.” According to the Southern
                        Poverty Law Center, he explicitly stated that “using the daily news is a means to
                        propagandize people.” He also often mobilizes his followers by directing them to
                        harass specific targets or manipulate the media on his behalf.
                        <br>
                        <img id="yelling" src="images/globe.png">
                        This was the case in November 2015, when he directed his followers to set up fake
                        White Student Union pages on Facebook for universities throughout the United
                        States—and then contact local media outlets about the groups. He stated openly
                        that he hoped real groups would indeed crop up on college campuses, so perhaps
                        he thought this stunt would be the first step towards that goal. Alternatively, he
                        may simply have been hoping to prove he could trick the media into moral outrage
                        and simultaneously spread some racial tension throughout college campuses.
                        <br>
                        In the latter sense, he was highly successful. Local media outlets promptly reported
                        the story and amplified his message (although some did note it was unclear
                        whether the groups existed outside of Facebook). USA Today picked up the
                        story and covered it without a hint of skepticism. Soon, an anonymous user on
                        Medium revealed the pages as a hoax engineered by Anglin. By this point, however, the entire
                        incident was considered a newsworthy controversy, and was thus
                        covered by Gawker, The Daily Beast, and even the The Washington Post.

                        Social bots are pieces of software that create content on social media and interact
                        with people. Increasingly, bots are used for political reasons: to inflate the numbers of
                        followers a politician has; to spread propaganda; to subtly influence political discourse; and
                        to aggregate and broadcast content.In countries ranging from
                        Azerbaijan to Italy to Venezuela, bots have been used by governments and political
                        elites, often to attack dissidents or manipulate news frames around an issue.

                        Bots were used extensively during the 2016 presidential election. For instance,
                        during the first presidential debate, bots generated 20% of the Twitter posts about
                        the debate, despite representing only
                        0.5% of users. Significantly more of
                        this traffic came from pro-Trump bots
                        than pro-Clinton bots. This remained
                        constant throughout the election;
                        researchers estimate that about a third of all pro-Trump tweets on Twitter were
                        generated by bots, more than four times that of pro-Clinton tweets. Many of
                        these bots spread what is known as “computational propaganda”: misinformation
                        and negative information about opposition candidates.165

                        Conspiracy theories are driven by a

                        conceal their role in an event or situation.
                        The overarching themes of these theories have
                        remained remarkably consistent: they reliably express anxieties about loss of control

                        In early October 2016, Wikileaks posted a dump of 20,000 hacked emails from the
                        Gmail account of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman. Users on an
                        internet message board called 8chan/pol/—short for “politically incorrect”—immediately began
                        combing through the emails looking for damaging material about
                        Hillary Clinton. Using social media, they spread allegations that George Soros was

                        was operating out of a Chevy Chase, Maryland pizza parlor, and that Clinton had
